        <h3>Experiences, education</h3>
        <h4>2019 March - </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm in the Team of Magyar Suzuki Zrt. IT department, exactly in the factory team. Now I am in <strong>Full Stack</strong> position because I do a lot of <strong>database</strong> work, and also create <strong>graphical</strong> interfaces. To solve all of the problems, I use Openedge <strong>Progress</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2018 October - 2019 February: Erasmus+ Traineeship, Cluj-Napoca</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I worked beside a network engineer, at Sapientia, Hungarian University of Transilvania. My job was to write a program, which can <strong>generate Google Forms</strong> from an <strong>Excel file</strong>. I used Google Script. In my free time I started to learn <strong>Android Development</strong>, used Java.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2015 September - 2018 Juni: Eotvos Lorand University, Computer Science Bsc</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned about basic algorithms, and several program languages like <strong>ADA, C++, C, SQL, Python</strong>. I have chosen mathematics department, so I also meet <strong>Matlab, Maple, Sage, and R</strong>, to modelling some problem and statistic.</li>
            <li>My thesis was a website called BaBi (Basic Bioinformatics) where students can get some basic knowledge about genetics, and can practice string algorithms. <a href=http://webprogramozas.inf.elte.hu/hallgatok/szekelygellert/ >http://webprogramozas.inf.elte.hu/hallgatok/szekelygellert/</a> I used <strong>HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL</strong>, and a little <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I worked in <strong>Atom</strong>, and got to know how to use <strong>Git</strong>, to follow the versions. I had to extend my university knowledge, so Google and <strong>Stackoverflow</strong> became my close friends.</li>
            <li>During the university years, I worked at weekends as a teacher in <strong>Logiscool</strong>. We used ScoolCode to set together games using blocks. I think, it is a very good way for kids beetwen 7-17 years to learn <strong>object orientated programming</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2013 September - 2014 May</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When I was in the class eleven, I travelled to Budapest every weekends to prepare myself to the higher level informatics exam. We used <strong>C#</strong> to practice.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I have an <strong>English B2</strong> language exam.</li>
            <li><strong>B category</strong> driving licence. </li>
            <li>I am <strong>communicative</strong>, creative, and opened to new <strong>technology</strong>.</li>
            <li>If I want to solve a problem, I'm very <strong>persistent</strong>, and there is nothing what can divert my attention. My father told: "If you do something, do it well". This is my attitude in all areas of life.</li>
            <li>In my free time I learn full stack web development </li>
